# Hash Functions
Given an Electronic telephone directory we are to create an application that uses 4 hash functions to generate hash values for each key (full name) in the directory. 
We then conduct an experiment to test how well a function generates unique and dispersed values. 
We are to use the information-theoretic notion of entropy that calculates the information content of a random variable. 
The hash function is the random variable.  A higher entropy is better.
A hash function is function that maps items into small indexes, these indexes are called hash values.
Entropy is an expected value of the average information content or measure of the unpredictability of the state. 
Content would refer to the number of times the same hash value appears and unpredictability is associated with the probability.
